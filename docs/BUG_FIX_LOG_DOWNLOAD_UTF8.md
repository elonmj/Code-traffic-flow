# BUG FIX: Log Download UTF-8 Encoding

**Date**: 2025-10-10  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocks diagnostic capability  
**Status**: Ready to implement

---

## Problem

**Symptom**: Kernel logs fail to download with encoding error:
```
[ERROR] Failed to download kernel output: Retry failed: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2192' in position 15926: character maps to <undefined>
```

**Impact**: 
- Cannot read full kernel logs
- Cannot diagnose bugs effectively
- Blocks iteration cycles
- Must manually fetch logs from Kaggle UI

**Root Cause**:
- Unicode characters in log (→, ✅, ❌ emojis)
- Python's default `open()` uses system encoding (Windows: cp1252)
- These characters not in cp1252 charset
- File write fails, log not saved

---

## Solution

**File**: `validation_ch7/validation_kaggle_manager.py`  
**Method**: `download_kernel_output()`  
**Line**: ~1160

**Change**: Add explicit UTF-8 encoding to file operations

**BEFORE**:
```python
with open(log_path, 'w') as f:  # Uses default encoding (cp1252 on Windows)
    f.write(log_text)
```

**AFTER**:
```python
with open(log_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:  # Explicit UTF-8
    f.write(log_text)
```

## Implementation

This fix will be applied together with Bug #7 fix.

**Expected Outcome**:
- All kernel logs download successfully
- Unicode characters preserved
- Enables rapid diagnostic cycles

**STATUS**: ✅ Solution identified - Ready to implement
