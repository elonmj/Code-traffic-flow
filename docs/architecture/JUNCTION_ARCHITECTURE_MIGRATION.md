# Junction Architecture Migration - SUMO/CityFlow Pattern Adoption

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary

Migrated `NetworkGrid._prepare_junction_info()` from indirect links iteration to
direct segment iteration, adopting the industry-standard architecture from SUMO and
CityFlow traffic simulators.

## Motivation

**Problem**: Previous implementation iterated on `self.links` to discover segment-junction
relationships. This approach:
- Missed segments without explicit Link objects
- Created false dependency on links list
- Differed from industry standards (SUMO, CityFlow)

**Solution**: Adopt direct segment→node reference pattern used by all major simulators.

## Changes

### Before (Indirect Pattern)
```python
for link in self.links:
    from_seg_id = link.from_segment
    node = link.via_node
    if node.traffic_lights is not None:
        # Set junction_info on from_seg
```

**Issues**:
- Only processes segments with links
- Indirect discovery (segment → link → node)
- Non-standard architecture

### After (Direct Pattern - SUMO/CityFlow)
```python
for seg_id, segment in self.segments.items():
    end_node_id = segment.get('end_node')
    if end_node_id is not None:
        node = self.nodes[end_node_id]
        if node.traffic_lights is not None:
            # Set junction_info on segment
```

**Improvements**:
- Processes ALL segments with end_node
- Direct discovery (segment → node)
- Matches SUMO/CityFlow architecture

## Validation

**Test Suite**: `tests/test_networkgrid_junction_architecture.py`
- ✅ All segments with junctions receive junction_info
- ✅ Independence from links list validated
- ✅ Signal state changes correctly reflected
- ⚠️ Congestion formation test infrastructure complete (boundary condition physics requires separate investigation)

- **SUMO**: `eclipse-sumo/sumo` (MSEdge.to_junction)
- **CityFlow**: `cityflow-project/CityFlow` (Road.end_intersection)

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Compatible**:
- Method signature unchanged
- Single-segment simulations unaffected
- Multi-segment simulations improved (no missing junctions)
- Existing tests pass (no regressions)
