# üéØ BUG #31 ROOT CAUSE FINAL SOLUTION
# We Need to Activate the Network System for Traffic Light Control!

## THE COMPLETE PICTURE

### What We Discovered:

1. **ARZ Model HAS a full network/node system** ‚úÖ
   - `arz_model/core/node_solver.py` - implements node flux solving
   - `arz_model/core/intersection.py` - intersection data structures  
   - `arz_model/core/traffic_lights.py` - traffic light controllers
   - `arz_model/numerics/network_coupling.py` - network coupling system

2. **But it's DISABLED in traffic_light_control scenario** ‚ùå
   - YAML has NO `network:` section
   - `has_network` defaults to False
   - Network system never activates!

3. **We're using WRONG approach** ‚ùå
   - Trying to modulate boundary conditions (LEFT inflow)
   - This doesn't work with ARZ physics (relaxation system)
   - Boundaries only affect ghost cells, not domain dynamics

### THE CORRECT APPROACH:

**Use the built-in NETWORK SYSTEM** ‚úÖ

Instead of:
```yaml
# WRONG: Single segment with boundary condition hacks
boundary_conditions:
  left: {type: inflow, state: [...]}
  right: {type: outflow}
```

Should be:
```yaml
# CORRECT: Two-segment network with intersection node
network:
  has_network: true
  segments:
    - id: "upstream"
      length: 500.0
      cells: 50
      is_source: true  # Can receive inflow
      is_sink: false
    - id: "downstream"
      length: 500.0
      cells: 50
      is_source: false
      is_sink: true  # Can output outflow

  nodes:
    - id: "traffic_light_1"
      segments: ["upstream", "downstream"]
      type: "signalized_intersection"
      traffic_lights:
        phase_duration: [60, 60]  # RED 60s, GREEN 60s
        signal_compliance: 0.7
        
  boundary_conditions:
    upstream:
      left: {type: inflow, state: [...]}  # Inflow on source segment
      right: {type: node_coupling}        # Coupled to node
    downstream:
      left: {type: node_coupling}         # Coupled to node
      right: {type: outflow}              # Outflow on sink segment
```

## WHAT THIS FIXES:

1. **RED Phase**: Node restricts flow based on traffic light signal
2. **GREEN Phase**: Node allows free flow
3. **Queue Formation**: Happens naturally through conservation laws at node
4. **RL Signal**: Agent sees REAL queue changes between RED and GREEN

## IMPLEMENTATION:

### Step 1: Update create_scenario_config_with_lagos_data() in Code_RL/src/utils/config.py

Add network configuration section with proper traffic light setup

### Step 2: Ensure parameters.py properly loads network config

Check that network_config properly extracts nodes and segments

### Step 3: Test that runner.py initializes network_coupling when has_network=True

Verify network_coupling is called in the time-stepping loop
