# Bug #36 GPU Validation - LIVE MONITORING STATUS

**Created**: 2025-10-16 07:50 UTC  
**Kernel**: `elonmj/arz-validation-76rlperformance-rjot`  
**Status**: 🔄 RUNNING on Kaggle GPU  
**Expected Completion**: 5-10 minutes  

---

## 🎯 MISSION: Verify Bug #36 Fix on GPU

### The Problem (Bug #36)
- **Issue**: GPU inflow BC delivering only 14.7% of configured density (0.044 vs 0.3 veh/m)
- **Root Cause**: `weno_gpu.py:301` bypassed dispatcher, used static `params.boundary_conditions`
- **Impact**: Queue never activated, velocities constant, RL training blocked

### The Fix Applied ✅
- **Modified Files**: 3 files, 10 locations
  - `weno_gpu.py` (2 changes): Added `current_bc_params`, dispatcher call
  - `time_integration.py` (9 changes): Thread parameter through GPU call stack
  - `runner.py` (4 changes): Pass `self.current_bc_params` to splitting functions
- **Compilation**: ✅ All code compiled without errors
- **Local Testing**: Blocked (CUDA toolkit missing on Windows)
- **GPU Testing**: Now running on Kaggle

### The Validation
- **Test Type**: Section 7.6 RL Performance (Revendication R5)
- **Mode**: QUICK TEST - 100 timesteps, ~15 min expected runtime
- **Metrics**: Density, Queue, Velocity, R_queue, RL convergence
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - Density ≥ 0.15 veh/m (50% improvement from 0.044)
  - Queue > 0 (must be > 0 to activate reward)
  - Velocity variation visible (< 8 m/s at density)
  - RL learning convergence

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS (When Complete)

### SUCCESS Scenario ✅
```
✅ Upstream Density: 0.15-0.30 veh/m (IMPROVED from 0.044)
✅ Queue Detection: max > 10 vehicles (IMPROVED from always 0)
✅ Velocity Profile: 6-12 m/s (IMPROVED from constant 11.11)
✅ R_queue Reward: Active, non-zero (IMPROVED from always 0)
✅ RL Training: Converging, loss ↓ reward ↑ (NEW behavior)
→ CONCLUSION: Bug #36 VERIFIED FIXED ✅
```

### FAILURE Scenario ❌
```
❌ Upstream Density: still ~0.044 veh/m (NO CHANGE)
❌ Queue: always 0 (NO CHANGE)
❌ Velocity: constant 11.11 m/s (NO CHANGE)
❌ R_queue: always 0 (NO CHANGE)
❌ RL Training: No convergence (NO CHANGE)
→ CONCLUSION: Bug #36 NOT FIXED, needs DEBUG
```

## 🔄 NEXT STEPS (In Order)

### Phase 1: RESULTS ARRIVAL (Next 5-10 min)
1. Kaggle kernel completes execution
2. Results download to local `validation_output/results/`
3. New directory appears: `elonmj_arz-validation-76rlperformance-*`

### Phase 2: ANALYSE (5 min)
1. Extract key metrics from results
2. Compare to baseline (14.7% density ratio)
3. Check if success criteria met
4. Document findings

### Phase 3: DECISION
- **IF metrics show improvement** → Fix VERIFIED, run full benchmark
- **IF metrics show NO improvement** → DEBUG parameter propagation

### Phase 4: CONDITIONAL ACTIONS
- **FIX VERIFIED**: Run `test_section_7_6_rl_performance.py` (5000 timesteps, 3-4 hours)
- **NEEDS DEBUG**: Add logging to `weno_gpu.py`, relaunch validation

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (WHEN RESULTS ARRIVE)

1. **Check results directory** for new `elonmj_arz-validation-76rlperformance-*`
2. **Extract metrics** from CSV and logs
3. **Compare to baseline**: Is density ≥ 0.15 veh/m? (14.7% → 50% improvement)
4. **Evaluate queue**: Is max queue > 0? (0 → > 0)
5. **Check velocity**: Do velocities vary < 8 m/s?
6. **DECISION**: Fix verified or needs debugging?

## 📌 KEY SUCCESS INDICATOR

The single most important metric:
- **Upstream mean density**: Should move from **0.044 → ≥ 0.15 veh/m**
- If density improved: Fix is working ✅ → Proceed to full benchmark
- If density unchanged: Parameter not reaching GPU kernel ❌ → Debug & retry

**Status**: Kernel executing on Kaggle GPU  
**Next Update**: When results directory appears (5-10 min)  
**Action**: Monitor, then ANALYSE results immediately upon arrival

*This document serves as the checkpoint between GPU validation launch and analysis phase.
Results will confirm whether Bug #36 fix is successful before proceeding to full benchmark.*
