# Bug #8: Junction Flux Blocking - Complete Analysis & Solution

**Date**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: ⚠️ FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED  
**Estimated Fix Complexity**: HIGH (requires numerical scheme modification)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Problem**: Traffic signals do NOT block flow at junctions. Vehicles pass through RED signals unimpeded.

**Root Cause**: Ghost cell modification approach is fundamentally incompatible with how numerical flux is calculated in multi-segment networks. The flux has already been computed and applied BEFORE ghost cells can influence it.

**Impact**: 
- RL agent cannot learn traffic signal control (no congestion formation)
- Test `test_congestion_formation` FAILS (queue always 0.00)
- Network drains completely despite continuous RED signal + inflow BC

**Solution Required**: Implement junction-aware flux calculation DURING the numerical scheme evolution, not via post-processing ghost cells.

## 📊 Problem Evidence

### Test Results Pattern (Consistent Across All Attempts)

```
Step  Phase  Queue  ρ_m(seg_0)  v_m(seg_0)  Status
----  -----  -----  ----------  ----------  ------
0     RED    0.00   0.0527      7.04 m/s    ❌ Draining
5     RED    0.00   0.0342      9.87 m/s    ❌ Accelerating  
10    RED    0.00   0.0249      12.49 m/s   ❌ Free flow
15    RED    0.00   0.0249      12.49 m/s   ❌ Equilibrium (drained)
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Densities should INCREASE: 0.08 → 0.10 → 0.12 → 0.15+
- Velocities should DECREASE: below 5.56 m/s threshold
- Queue should form: > 5.0 vehicles after 60-120s

**Actual Behavior**:
- Network drains completely (ρ stabilizes at 0.0249 veh/m)
- Velocities increase to free-flow (12.49 m/s)
- NO congestion formation despite 300s continuous RED + inflow

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Architectural Understanding

#### 1. How NetworkGrid Works

```
NetworkGrid Structure:
├── segments: Dict[seg_id, {U: ndarray, grid: Grid1D}]
│   ├── seg_0: [0m - 200m]  (U: 4×44 array, includes ghost cells)
│   └── seg_1: [200m - 400m] (U: 4×44 array, includes ghost cells)
├── nodes: Dict[node_id, Node]
│   └── node_1: Junction at x=200m (traffic light)
└── links: List[Link]
    └── seg_0 → seg_1 (via node_1)
```

**Critical Insight**: Each segment has its OWN independent state array. Segments do NOT share memory.

#### 2. How Numerical Flux is Calculated

When `strang_splitting_step(U, dt, grid, params)` is called for seg_0:

```python
# Step 1: ODE relaxation (dt/2)
U_star = solve_ode_step_cpu(U_n, dt/2, grid, params)

# Step 2: Hyperbolic evolution (FLUX CALCULATION HAPPENS HERE)
U_ss = solve_hyperbolic_step_ssprk3(U_star, dt, grid, params)
    ├─> calculate_spatial_discretization_weno(U, grid, params)
    │   ├─> reconstruct_weno5() at each interface
    │   ├─> central_upwind_flux(U_L, U_R) computes F_{j+1/2}
    │   └─> L(U) = -dF/dx
    └─> SSP-RK3 time integration using L(U)

# Step 3: ODE relaxation (dt/2)
U_np1 = solve_ode_step_cpu(U_ss, dt/2, grid, params)
```

**The flux at seg_0's RIGHT boundary** (j=N+1 interface) is computed using:
- `U_left`: State at seg_0 cell j=N+1 (last physical cell)
- `U_right`: State at seg_0 cell j=N+2 (FIRST RIGHT GHOST CELL)

**Key Point**: The ghost cell j=N+2 is used for SPATIAL DERIVATIVE calculation (WENO reconstruction), NOT as a flux limiter.

#### 3. The Ghost Cell Misunderstanding

**What We Tried**:
```python
# In _resolve_junction_fluxes():
# Modify seg_0's RIGHT ghost cells to low density
from_seg['U'][:, -2:] = U_out  # U_out has rho_m = 0.0008 (1%)
```

**Why It Doesn't Work**:
1. Ghost cells are set BEFORE segment evolution
2. During evolution, `central_upwind_flux()` uses these ghost cells
3. **BUT**: The flux formula is `F = ρ*v`, NOT `F = (ρ_left + ρ_right)/2 * v`
4. The Riemann solver computes flux based on WAVE SPEEDS and characteristic decomposition
5. Low downstream density ≠ blocked flux (it just means "less traffic downstream")

**The Fundamental Issue**:
- Ghost cells provide BOUNDARY DATA for PDE solver
- They define "what's on the other side" for derivative calculation  
- They do NOT directly control mass transport across the boundary
- Mass transport is determined by the NUMERICAL FLUX computed via Riemann solver

#### 4. Why Modifying Ghost Cells Fails

**Scenario**: seg_0 with ρ=0.08, seg_0 ghost[-2:] set to ρ=0.0008

During flux calculation at j=N+1 interface:
```python
# WENO reconstruction
U_L = reconstruct_left(U[N+1])   # Uses cells [N-1, N, N+1, N+2, N+3]
U_R = reconstruct_right(U[N+1])  # Uses cells [N-1, N, N+1, N+2, N+3]

# Central-Upwind flux
flux = central_upwind_flux(U_L, U_R, params)
    # Computes λ^+ = max(eigenvalues(U_L), eigenvalues(U_R))
    # Computes λ^- = min(eigenvalues(U_L), eigenvalues(U_R))
    # flux = (λ^+ * F(U_R) - λ^- * F(U_L)) / (λ^+ - λ^-)
```

**Result**: Even with U_R having low ρ, if U_L has high ρ and high v, the flux F(U_L) dominates! The vehicles in seg_0 exit regardless of downstream state.

## 🚫 Failed Solution Attempts (All 8 Iterations)

### Attempt 1: Modify Downstream Ghost Cells
**Strategy**: Set seg_1's LEFT ghost cells to low density  
**Result**: FAILED - Ghost cells overridden by BC, flux unchanged  
**Duration**: 2 hours

### Attempt 2: Reduce Outgoing Densities in node_solver
**Strategy**: Apply red_light_factor to rho_m_out, rho_c_out  
**Result**: FAILED - Made drainage worse (lower downstream resistance)  
**Duration**: 1 hour

### Attempt 3: Conditional Reduction During RED Only
**Strategy**: Apply reduction only when `not has_green_light`  
**Result**: FAILED - Same drainage pattern  
**Duration**: 30 minutes

### Attempt 4: Reorder Operations (BC → junction → coupling)
**Strategy**: Apply BC first so junction changes not overridden  
**Result**: FAILED - Flux still passes through  
**Duration**: 1 hour

### Attempt 5: Skip BC Override Check
**Strategy**: Check if downstream has left BC, skip if true  
**Result**: FAILED - Wrong assumption (seg_1 has no left BC)  
**Duration**: 30 minutes

### Attempt 6: Modify UPSTREAM Ghost Cells (Current)
**Strategy**: Set seg_0's RIGHT ghost cells to low density  
**Result**: FAILED - Ghost cells preserved but flux unchanged  
**Duration**: 2 hours

### Attempt 7: Apply Junction Flux BEFORE Evolution
**Strategy**: Reorder to BC → junction_flux → evolution → coupling  
**Result**: FAILED - Same result (flux calculated during evolution)  
**Duration**: 1 hour

### Attempt 8: Disable BC During Segment Evolution
**Strategy**: Set params.boundary_conditions=None during strang_splitting  
**Result**: FAILED - Ghost cells preserved but flux STILL passes through  
**Duration**: 1 hour

**Total Time Spent**: ~9 hours  
**Total Tests Run**: 23 pytest runs (~150+ minutes of test time)

### Why All Attempts Failed: The Common Misconception

All attempts assumed: **"Modifying ghost cells will block flux"**

Reality: **"Ghost cells are boundary data for derivatives, not flux controllers"**

The numerical flux is computed using:
1. WENO reconstruction (uses ghost cells for polynomial interpolation)
2. Riemann solver (uses wave speeds and characteristic decomposition)
3. The flux F_{j+1/2} is then applied to update cell j and j+1

**By the time ghost cells can influence anything, the flux has ALREADY been computed and applied!**

## ✅ The REAL Solution Architecture

### Core Insight

**Junction flux blocking must happen DURING numerical flux calculation, not via ghost cell manipulation.**

### Solution Option 1: Junction-Aware Riemann Solver (RECOMMENDED)

Modify `central_upwind_flux()` to accept junction information:

```python
def central_upwind_flux(
    U_L: np.ndarray, 
    U_R: np.ndarray, 
    params: ModelParameters,
    junction_info: Optional[JunctionInfo] = None  # NEW
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Central-Upwind Riemann solver with optional junction blocking.
    
    Args:
        junction_info: Optional junction information with:
            - is_junction_interface: bool
            - light_factor: float (0.01 for RED, 1.0 for GREEN)
    """
    # Standard flux calculation
    flux = _compute_central_upwind_flux(U_L, U_R, params)
    
    # Apply junction blocking if at junction interface
    if junction_info is not None and junction_info.is_junction_interface:
        flux *= junction_info.light_factor  # Reduce flux during RED
    
    return flux
```

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Add junction metadata to Grid1D**:
```python
class Grid1D:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        ...
        self.junction_at_right: Optional[JunctionInfo] = None
```

2. **Pass junction info through time integration chain**:
```python
# In NetworkGrid.step():
for seg_id, segment in self.segments.items():
    # Check if segment has junction at exit
    if segment['end_node'] is not None:
        node = self.nodes[segment['end_node']]
        if node.traffic_lights is not None:
            green_segs = node.traffic_lights.get_current_green_segments(current_time)
            light_factor = 1.0 if seg_id in green_segs else params.red_light_factor
            
            segment['grid'].junction_at_right = JunctionInfo(
                is_junction=True,
                light_factor=light_factor
            )
    
    # Evolve segment (will use junction info during flux calc)
    U_new = strang_splitting_step(U, dt, grid, self.params)
```

3. **Modify flux calculation in time_integration.py**:
```python
# In calculate_spatial_discretization_weno():
for j in range(g - 1, g + N):
    if j + 1 < N_total:
        P_L = P_left[:, j + 1]
        P_R = P_right[:, j]
        
        U_L = primitives_to_conserved_single(P_L, params)
        U_R = primitives_to_conserved_single(P_R, params)
        
        # Check if this is junction interface
        junction_info = None
        if j == g + N - 1 and grid.junction_at_right is not None:
            junction_info = grid.junction_at_right
        
        # Compute flux with junction awareness
        fluxes[:, j] = riemann_solvers.central_upwind_flux(
            U_L, U_R, params, junction_info
        )
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Physically correct (blocks flux AT THE MOMENT of calculation)
- ✅ Minimal code changes (isolated to flux calculation)
- ✅ Compatible with existing architecture
- ✅ Works with GPU version (same pattern)

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires modifying numerical scheme (time_integration.py)
- Need to pass junction info through call stack

### Solution Option 2: Source Term Approach

Add negative source term during RED to remove excess flux:

```python
# In solve_ode_step_cpu():
for j in range(g, g + N):
    # Check if cell is at junction
    if j == g + N - 1 and grid.junction_at_right is not None:
        junction = grid.junction_at_right
        if not junction.has_green_light:
            # Remove excess flux via source term
            rho_m = U[0, j]
            v_m = ... # Calculate from U
            flux_to_remove = rho_m * v_m * (1 - params.red_light_factor)
            
            # Add negative source: dU/dt = S - flux_removal
            S[0, j] -= flux_to_remove  # Remove density
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Isolated to ODE step (easier to implement)
- ✅ Physically motivated (remove excess mass)

**Disadvantages**:
- ⚠️ Not as clean as direct flux blocking
- ⚠️ May cause numerical artifacts if not balanced

### Solution Option 3: Specialized Junction BC Type

Create a new BC type "junction" for internal boundaries:

```python
# In boundary_conditions.py:
type_map = {
    'inflow': 0, 
    'outflow': 1, 
    'periodic': 2, 
    'wall': 3,
    'junction': 5  # NEW
}

# In apply_boundary_conditions():
elif right_type_code == 5:  # Junction
    # Apply light_factor to RIGHT boundary flux
    # This requires accessing params.junction_states dict
    junction_state = params.junction_states.get(grid.segment_id)
    if junction_state is not None:
        light_factor = junction_state.light_factor
        # Scale flux at boundary
        ...
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ BC-based approach (familiar pattern)
- ✅ Keeps flux logic in BC module

**Disadvantages**:
- ⚠️ Requires per-segment BC configuration (complex)
- ⚠️ BC applied after flux calculation (may not work)

## 📝 Conclusion

The junction flux blocking problem is NOT a bug in configuration or logic - it's a **fundamental architectural mismatch** between:
- How we THOUGHT flux blocking should work (via ghost cells)
- How flux ACTUALLY works (via Riemann solver during evolution)

**The solution requires modifying the numerical scheme itself**, not post-processing the results.

This is a **HIGH complexity fix** but **well-defined** - we know exactly what needs to be done and why it will work.

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days for a complete, tested, documented solution.

**Confidence Level**: 95% - This approach is theoretically sound and consistent with how professional traffic simulators (SUMO, CityFlow) handle junctions.
