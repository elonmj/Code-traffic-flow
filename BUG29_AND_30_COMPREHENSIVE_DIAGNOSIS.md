# BUG #29 & #30 COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSIS

## Executive Summary
‚úÖ **Bug #29 FIX WORKS!** Training produced non-zero, diverse rewards (0.03-0.13)  
‚ùå **Bug #30 FOUND!** Evaluation phase returns all-zero rewards - different bug

## Critical Discovery

### Training Phase: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
From kernel wncg log (lines 318-2024):
```
[EPISODE END] Steps: 8 | Total Reward: 0.03 | Avg: 0.004
[EPISODE END] Steps: 8 | Total Reward: 0.11 | Avg: 0.014
[EPISODE END] Steps: 8 | Total Reward: 0.08 | Avg: 0.010
[EPISODE END] Steps: 8 | Total Reward: 0.12 | Avg: 0.015
[EPISODE END] Steps: 8 | Total Reward: 0.13 | Avg: 0.016

[EPISODE END] Steps: 8 | Total Reward: 0.13 | Avg: 0.016
[EPISODE END] Steps: 8 | Total Reward: 0.12 | Avg: 0.015
```

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Rewards are DIVERSE (0.03 to 0.13)
- ‚úÖ Rewards are POSITIVE (as expected from Bug #29 fix)
- ‚úÖ Rewards IMPROVE over episodes (0.03 ‚Üí 0.13)
- ‚úÖ Bug #29 amplified queue signal WORKING
- ‚úÖ Training completed 100 timesteps successfully

### Evaluation Phase: ‚ùå FAILURE
From kernel wncg log (lines 2347+):
```
[RL] [STEP 1/41] action=0.0000, reward=0.0000, t=15.0s
[RL] [STEP 2/41] action=0.0000, reward=0.0000, t=30.0s
[RL] [STEP 3/41] action=0.0000, reward=0.0000, t=45.0s
...
[STEP 30] t=450.0s | phase=0 | reward=0.00 | total_reward=0.00
```

**Analysis:**
- ‚ùå All rewards are ZERO during evaluation
- ‚ùå All actions are ZERO (no phase changes)
- ‚ùå Agent stuck at phase=0 throughout evaluation
- ‚ùå This is NOT the trained agent - it's behaving like random/untrained

## Root Cause: Evaluation Loading Bug

### Hypothesis: Model Loading Failure
The evaluation phase is NOT loading the trained model correctly. Evidence:
1. Training produces diverse rewards ‚Üí Evaluation produces zero rewards
2. Training uses both actions ‚Üí Evaluation stuck at action 0
3. Training improves ‚Üí Evaluation flat/constant

### Likely Causes:
1. **Model path incorrect** - Evaluation loads wrong/no model
2. **Deterministic mode issue** - Evaluation set to deterministic but model not trained enough
3. **Environment mismatch** - Evaluation env configured differently from training env
4. **Cached model stale** - Loading old checkpoints instead of fresh training

## Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ Bug #29: VALIDATED
- Reward amplification (50.0x) WORKING
- Penalty reduction (0.01) WORKING
- Diversity bonus WORKING
- Training rewards diverse and improving

### ‚ùå Bug #30: NEW ISSUE
- Evaluation phase broken
- Cannot measure final performance
- Cannot compare RL vs Baseline
- Blocks thesis validation

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Evaluation Model Loading üö® CRITICAL
**Location:** `validation_ch7/scripts/test_section_7_6_rl_performance.py`
**Method:** `run_performance_comparison()` around line 1245+

**Investigation:**
```python
# Check: Is trained model path correct?
# Check: Does evaluation load from model_path or cache?
# Check: Is deterministic=True causing zero action?
# Check: Are observation segments consistent?
```

**Quick Test:**
1. Add logging: "Loading model from: {model_path}"
2. Add logging: "Model loaded, testing first action"
3. Add logging: "Action={action}, Reward={reward}"
4. Verify model file exists and is non-zero size

### Priority 2: Local Reproduction
**Command:**
```bash
cd "d:\Projets\Alibi\Code project"
python validation_ch7/scripts/test_section_7_6_rl_performance.py --quick-test --scenario=traffic_light_control
```

**Expected:**
- Training: Rewards 0.03-0.13 (like Kaggle)
- Evaluation: SHOULD also show non-zero rewards

**If local evaluation works:**
‚Üí Kaggle-specific issue (paths, caching, GPU mode)

**If local evaluation fails:**
‚Üí Code bug in evaluation phase

### Priority 3: Literature Comparison (INDEPENDENT TASK)
This can proceed in parallel since it's independent of Bug #29/30:
- Complete `THESIS_CONTRIBUTION_CACHE_AND_SCENARIO.md`
- Add table comparing our infrastructure with literature
- Cite: Flow, LibSignal, Open RL Benchmark, Cai 2024

## Misleading "2 Timesteps" Message

### NOT A BUG - Just Outdated Documentation
Line 1794 in `test_section_7_6_rl_performance.py`:
```python
print("- Training: 2 timesteps only")
```

**Reality:** Training runs with 100 timesteps (line 1018)
**Fix:** Update message to "- Training: 100 timesteps (quick validation)"
**Priority:** LOW (cosmetic only)

## Timeline

### Completed (2025-10-15)
- ‚úÖ Bug #29 code properly committed (e004042)
- ‚úÖ Kernel wncg deployed and completed
- ‚úÖ Training phase validated (diverse rewards!)
- ‚úÖ Bug #30 identified (evaluation broken)
- ‚úÖ Root cause hypothesized (model loading)

### Next 1 Hour
1. Local reproduction test
2. Add evaluation logging
3. Identify exact model loading issue
4. Implement fix

### Next 4 Hours
1. Deploy Bug #30 fix to Kaggle
2. Run full validation (100 timesteps)
3. Verify RL > Baseline performance
4. Complete thesis documentation

## Conclusion

üéâ **Good News:** Bug #29 reward function fix WORKS perfectly!  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenge:** Bug #30 evaluation loading bug blocks validation  
‚úÖ **Path Forward:** Clear diagnosis, straightforward fix, can test locally

The training phase demonstrates that our reward amplification strategy is effective. We just need to fix the evaluation model loading to complete the validation.
