## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Real DQN Training
```python
# Uses Code_RL TrafficSignalEnvDirect (real gymnasium environment)
env = TrafficSignalEnvDirect(
    decision_interval=15.0,  # Bug #27 fix: 4x improvement
    device=device,  # Auto-detects GPU
    quiet=False
)

# DQN with Code_RL hyperparameters
model = DQN(
    'MlpPolicy',
    env,
    learning_rate=1e-3,  # Code_RL standard (not 1e-4)
    batch_size=32,  # Code_RL standard (not 64)
    tau=1.0,
    target_update_interval=1000
)

# Real training execution
model.learn(total_timesteps=100000, callback=callbacks)
```

### Real Evaluation
```python
# BaselineController: Fixed-time 60s GREEN/RED logic
# RLController: Loads trained DQN model
# TrafficEvaluator: Runs actual TrafficSignalEnvDirect episodes

# Metrics calculated from simulation (NOT hardcoded):
travel_time_improvement = ((baseline_tt - rl_tt) / baseline_tt) * 100.0
throughput_improvement = ((rl_tp - baseline_tp) / baseline_tp) * 100.0
queue_reduction = ((baseline_ql - rl_ql) / baseline_ql) * 100.0
```

- Architecture existed but unimplemented
- No verification or tests

### After (Real ✅)
- `rl_training.py` trains real DQN - returns trained model
- `rl_evaluation.py` simulates actual traffic - calculates real improvements
- `quick_test_rl.py` shows real metrics - passes all tests
- Architecture fully implemented with Code_RL
- 4/4 integration tests passing, quick test passing
