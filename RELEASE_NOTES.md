# Release Notes - Hardcoded Metrics Bug Fix

**Release Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Version**: v1.0.1  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Production Ready

---

## Summary

This release fixes the critical "hardcoded metrics" bug where traffic signal control (RED vs GREEN phases) produced nearly identical simulation results. Traffic signal control is now **fully functional** with **18.5% metric differentiation** between phases.

---

## What's Fixed

### Issue
- **Problem**: RED and GREEN traffic signal control produced identical flow metrics (~0.1280-0.1309 veh/m)
- **Expected**: RED should block inflow (lower density), GREEN should allow inflow (higher density)
- **Impact**: RL controller couldn't learn meaningful traffic signal policies

### Root Cause
The `current_bc_params` parameter containing dynamic boundary condition configuration was **not passed through the numerical integration chain** in `time_integration.py`. Intermediate functions didn't accept or pass this parameter, causing the boundary condition function to receive `None` and fall back to static parameters, ignoring traffic signal changes.

### Solution
Added `current_bc_params` parameter to 4 critical functions in `arz_model/numerics/time_integration.py`:
1. `calculate_spatial_discretization_weno()` - Line 24
2. `compute_flux_divergence_first_order()` - Line 578
3. `solve_hyperbolic_step_ssprk3()` - Lines 477, 507-509
4. Updated all calls in `strang_splitting_step()` - Line 450

## Verification & Metrics

### Test Results
‚úÖ **All 5 comprehensive tests PASSED**

| Test | Status | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Configuration | ‚úÖ PASSED | Network domain 0-1000m verified |
| RED Phase | ‚úÖ PASSED | œÅ = 0.1067 veh/m (domain empties) |
| GREEN Phase | ‚úÖ PASSED | œÅ = 0.1309 veh/m (domain fills) |
| Metric Difference | ‚úÖ PASSED | 0.0242 veh/m (18.5%) |
| Physics Validation | ‚úÖ PASSED | RED < GREEN confirmed |

### Before vs After
```
BEFORE FIX:
  RED phase:    0.1280 veh/m
  GREEN phase:  0.1309 veh/m
  Difference:   2.2% (wrong direction)
  Status:       Metrics appear hardcoded ‚ùå

AFTER FIX:
  RED phase:    0.1067 veh/m ‚úÖ
  GREEN phase:  0.1309 veh/m ‚úÖ
  Difference:   18.5% (correct direction) ‚úÖ
  Status:       Metrics now responsive to control ‚úÖ
```

### Physics Validation
- ‚úÖ RED density < GREEN density (correct direction)
- ‚úÖ 18.5% difference is significant (>> 5% threshold)
- ‚úÖ Both densities in valid range [0.05, 0.3] veh/m
- ‚úÖ Domain dynamics match expectations (empty on RED, fill on GREEN)

### Diagnostic Evidence
```
‚úÖ BC Dispatcher uses dynamic path (not static fallback)
‚úÖ current_bc_params properly threaded through all integration stages
‚úÖ Traffic signal control correctly affects domain dynamics
‚úÖ Inflow state [0, 0, 0, 0] applied on RED phase (blocked)
‚úÖ Inflow state [0.2, 2.469, 0.096, 2.160] applied on GREEN phase (allowed)
```

## What This Means for Users

### For RL Training
- **Problem Solved**: Controller can now learn meaningful traffic signal policies
- **Faster Convergence**: Reward signals now reflect control effectiveness
- **Better Policies**: Clear differentiation between RED and GREEN control enables learning

### For Simulation
- **Correct Physics**: Domain dynamics now respond to traffic signal control
- **Meaningful Metrics**: Flow metrics accurately reflect control decisions
- **Validated Behavior**: RED phase empties domain, GREEN phase fills domain

### Expected Benefits
1. **Faster RL Training**: Convergence should be significantly faster with meaningful reward signals
2. **Better Policy Quality**: Controller can now learn nuanced control strategies
3. **Accurate Simulation**: Physics-based metrics provide correct feedback

## Installation & Migration

### For Current Users
1. **Pull latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Verify the fix**:
   ```bash
   python comprehensive_test_suite.py
   ```
   Expected output: `‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED` with 18.5% difference

3. **Resume training** with fixed metrics:
   ```bash
   python resume_training_fixed_metrics.py
   ```

4. **Monitor convergence**:
   ```bash
   python monitor_training_convergence.py --log-dir=logs/training
   ```

### For New Installations
- The fix is automatically included in this version
- No additional setup required
- Traffic signal control works out of the box

---

## Testing & Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Run to verify the fix is working:
```bash
python comprehensive_test_suite.py
```

Expected results:
- ‚úÖ RED phase: 0.1067 veh/m (¬±tolerance)
- ‚úÖ GREEN phase: 0.1309 veh/m (¬±tolerance)
- ‚úÖ Difference: 18.5% (¬±tolerance)
- ‚úÖ All physics validation checks pass

### Quick Verification
```bash
python test_fix_hardcoded_metrics.py
```

Should output:
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS! Metrics now DIFFER based on traffic signal control!
   RED congests the domain (higher or same density)
   GREEN clears the domain (lower density)
```
