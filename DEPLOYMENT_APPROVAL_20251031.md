## 🔧 Critical Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Production Code Path ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Junction blocking not working in default configuration  
**Cause**: Missing junction_info in first_order spatial discretization  
**Fix**: Added junction detection to compute_flux_divergence_first_order()  
**Result**: Junction blocking now works in production

### Bug #2: Numerical Instability ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Non-finite values (NaN/Inf) during simulation  
**Cause**: red_light_factor=0.01 too aggressive (99% blocking)  
**Fix**: Changed to red_light_factor=0.05 (95% blocking)  
**Result**: Stable 6+ minute simulations without errors

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Technical Insights
1. **Default vs Test Settings**: Production uses first_order, tests use weno5
2. **Stability Tuning**: 95% blocking optimal (99% too aggressive)
3. **Test Execution**: Thorough tests require significant time (acceptable)

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Incremental Validation**: Test each phase thoroughly
2. **Debug Early**: Remove debug output during development
3. **Production Path**: Always test with default configurations

### Best Practices
1. **Critical Path Validation**: Focus on production code paths
2. **Stability First**: Prioritize numerical stability over exact theoretical values
3. **Pragmatic Testing**: Balance thoroughness with practical execution time
