---

## Executive Summary

This report presents the final validation of the ARZ two-class traffic flow model (Revendication R2) using **REAL Lagos TomTom traffic data** instead of synthetic observations. The validation was conducted as part of SPRINT 4 - Real-World Data Validation (Niveau 3).

### Data Source
- **Location**: Lagos, Nigeria (West Africa)
- **Data Type**: TomTom Traffic API segment-level observations
- **Time Period**: 2025-09-24, 10:41:40 → 15:54:46 (~5.2 hours)
- **Segments**: 4 unique streets (Akin Adesola, Ahmadu Bello Way, Adeola Odeku, Saka Tinubu)
- **Total Raw Lines**: 116,416 observations
- **Valid Observations**: 4,270 (after cleaning malformed data)
- **Vehicle Classification**: 40% motorcycles (1,708 obs), 60% cars (2,562 obs)

### Validation Results Summary

| Test | Status | ARZ Predicted | Real Observed | Error | Threshold |
|------|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| **Speed Differential** | ❌ FAIL | Δv = 10.0 km/h | Δv = 1.8 km/h | **82.1%** | <10% |
| **Throughput Ratio** | ❌ FAIL | Q_m/Q_c = 1.50 | Q_m/Q_c = 0.67 | **55.6%** | <15% |
| **Fundamental Diagrams** | ✅ **PASS** | — | ρ_avg = **0.88** | — | >0.7 |
| **Infiltration Rate** | ❌ FAIL | 50-80% | **29.1%** | Below range | In range |

**Overall**: 1/4 tests passed (25%) → **R2 NOT VALIDATED** ❌

### Key Findings

1. **Fundamental Diagram Correlation** ✅
   - **ONLY test passed** with strong correlation (ρ = 0.88)
   - Motorcycles: ρ = 0.92 (p < 0.001, n=215 points)
   - Cars: ρ = 0.85 (p < 0.001, n=215 points)
   - **Interpretation**: ARZ model correctly predicts Q-ρ relationships despite other discrepancies

2. **Speed Differential** ❌
   - **CRITICAL DISCREPANCY**: Real Δv = 1.8 km/h vs ARZ predicted 10.0 km/h
   - **82.1% error** (far exceeds 10% threshold)
   - Real speeds: Motorcycles 33.3 ± 9.2 km/h, Cars 31.5 ± 9.5 km/h
   - **Possible explanations**:
     - Lagos congestion reduces speed differential
     - Heuristic vehicle classification may misattribute speeds
     - ARZ calibration based on different traffic conditions (hypothetical West African urban)
     - TomTom segment-level data may not capture instantaneous speed differences

3. **Throughput Ratio** ❌
   - **CONSISTENT FAILURE** (same as synthetic data: 55.6% error)
   - Real: Q_m/Q_c = 0.67 vs ARZ predicted 1.50
   - Real throughputs: Q_motos = 327 veh/h, Q_cars = 491 veh/h
   - **Interpretation**: Cars dominate traffic flow in Lagos, opposite of ARZ prediction

4. **Infiltration Rate** ❌
   - Real: 29.1% vs expected 50-80%
   - **Below threshold**: Some infiltration present but less than model predicts
   - Car-dominated segments: 2 out of 4
   - **Interpretation**: Motorcycles show some infiltration behavior but less pronounced than theoretical expectation

**Traffic Composition**:
```
Motorcycles: 1,708 observations (40.0%)
  - Mean speed: 33.3 km/h
  - Std deviation: 9.2 km/h
  - Median speed: 36.0 km/h

Cars: 2,562 observations (60.0%)
  - Mean speed: 31.5 km/h
  - Std deviation: 9.5 km/h
  - Median speed: 34.0 km/h

Speed differential: Δv = 1.8 km/h (motorcycles slightly faster)
```

**Fundamental Diagram Metrics**:
```
Motorcycles:
  - Q_max = 1,206 veh/h
  - ρ_max = 0.0360 veh/m
  - Valid FD points: 215

Cars:
  - Q_max = 1,504 veh/h
  - ρ_max = 0.0400 veh/m
  - Valid FD points: 215
```

**Spatial Distribution**:
```
Segregation Index: 0.232
Position Separation: ≈ 116 m
Infiltration Rate: 29.1%
```

**Statistical Tests**:
```
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test:
  - D-statistic: 0.1358
  - p-value: < 0.001 (highly significant difference)

Mann-Whitney U Test:
  - U-statistic: 2,431,330
  - p-value: < 0.001 (distributions differ significantly)
```

### 2. Comparison with ARZ Predictions

#### Test 1: Speed Differential ❌

**ARZ Prediction**:
- Δv_pred = 10.0 km/h (conservative baseline from SPRINT 3)
- Based on theoretical motorcycle agility advantage
- Calibration: Gap-filling and interweaving parameters

**Real Observation**:
- Δv_real = 1.8 km/h
- Absolute error: 8.2 km/h
- **Relative error: 82.1%** (threshold: 10%)

**Why FAIL?**

Possible explanations for large discrepancy:
1. **Lagos Congestion**: Severe urban congestion may limit motorcycle speed advantage
2. **Vehicle Classification Heuristic**: Our 40/60 split based on speed_ratio may misclassify some vehicles
3. **Data Aggregation**: TomTom segment-level means may smooth out peak speed differences
4. **Traffic Regime**: Lagos traffic may be in different flow regime than ARZ calibration assumed
5. **Model Assumption**: ARZ assumes free-flowing motorcycles; reality may be different

**Recommendation**: Re-calibrate ARZ velocity relaxation parameters (τ_v) with Lagos-specific data, or revise speed differential expectations for highly congested urban scenarios.

#### Test 2: Throughput Ratio ❌

**ARZ Prediction**:
- Q_m/Q_c = 1.50 (motorcycles 50% higher throughput than cars)
- Based on smaller effective width and higher agility

**Real Observation**:
- Q_m/Q_c = 0.67 (cars 49% higher throughput than motorcycles!)
- Q_motos = 327 veh/h
- Q_cars = 491 veh/h
- **Relative error: 55.6%** (threshold: 15%)

**Why FAIL?**

Observations suggest:
1. **Traffic Composition**: Cars numerically dominate (60% vs 40%)
2. **Infrastructure**: Lagos roads may favor cars over motorcycles (wider lanes, barriers)
3. **Behavioral**: Cars may move more continuously; motorcycles may stop-and-go more
4. **Data Limitation**: Our count-based throughput may not capture true flow dynamics
5. **Time Window**: 5-hour observation may not be representative of peak motorcycle activity

**Recommendation**: 
- Collect hourly breakdown data to identify peak motorcycle periods
- Verify infrastructure characteristics (lane widths, barriers, restrictions)
- Consider calibrating ARZ with context-specific width ratios (w_m/w_c)

#### Test 3: Fundamental Diagram Correlation ✅ PASS

**ARZ Prediction**:
- Theoretical Q-ρ relationships from SPRINT 3 FD predictions
- Based on LWR + 2-class interactions

**Real Observation**:
- **Motorcycles**: ρ = 0.92 (p < 0.001, n=215)
- **Cars**: ρ = 0.85 (p < 0.001, n=215)
- **Average correlation**: ρ_avg = **0.88** (threshold: >0.7)

**Why PASS?** ✅

Despite failures in other tests, the fundamental Q-ρ relationship is **strongly validated**:
- Very high correlation (0.88 >> 0.7 threshold)
- Statistically significant (p < 0.001)
- Consistent across both vehicle classes
- 215 data points provide robust statistical power

**Interpretation**:
- ARZ captures the **fundamental flow-density physics** correctly
- Speed differential and throughput issues may be **parametric** (calibration) rather than **structural** (model architecture)
- This is **encouraging** for model refinement: core physics correct, parameters need adjustment

#### Test 4: Infiltration Rate ❌

**ARZ Prediction**:
- Expected: 50-80% infiltration rate
- Based on theoretical motorcycle maneuvering advantage
- Calibration: Interweaving and gap-filling simulations

**Real Observation**:
- Observed: **29.1%** infiltration rate
- Car-dominated segments: 2 out of 4
- **Below expected range**

**Why FAIL?**

Possible explanations:
1. **Infrastructure Barriers**: Physical lane separations or barriers limiting infiltration
2. **Behavioral Caution**: Lagos motorcyclists may be more cautious than theoretical model assumes
3. **Traffic Density**: High density may limit infiltration opportunities
4. **Data Resolution**: Segment-level data may not capture micro-scale infiltration events
5. **Definition Mismatch**: Our segment-based infiltration metric may differ from ARZ's trajectory-based definition

**Recommendation**:
- Collect trajectory-level GPS data to measure true infiltration events
- Observe infrastructure (barriers, lane markings, regulations)
- Calibrate infiltration parameters (p_infiltrate, gap_threshold) with real observations

### 3. Data Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Real-world Lagos traffic observations (not synthetic)
- ✅ 4,270 valid data points after cleaning
- ✅ 5+ hour time window captures diverse conditions
- ✅ 4 unique street segments provide spatial diversity
- ✅ Statistical tests show significant vehicle class differences
- ✅ 215 FD points per class provide robust correlation analysis

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️ TomTom Traffic API provides segment-level aggregates, not individual trajectories
- ⚠️ Vehicle classification heuristic (40/60 split) may introduce errors
- ⚠️ ~112k raw lines discarded due to malformed CSV data (96% data loss)
- ⚠️ No direct density measurements (estimated from count/segment_length)
- ⚠️ No trajectory-level metrics (lane changes, gaps, following distances)
- ⚠️ Single day observation may not represent typical conditions
- ⚠️ Segment length assumed (500m avg) for density estimation

**Recommended Improvements**:
1. Acquire GPS probe data for trajectory-level analysis
2. Validate vehicle classification with manual observation or camera data
3. Extend observation period to multiple days/weeks
4. Include peak hour periods (morning/evening rush)
5. Collect infrastructure metadata (lane counts, widths, barriers)
6. Add weather/event data to context validation

## Scientific Interpretation

### What Does This Tell Us About ARZ Model?

**Positive Findings** ✅:
1. **Fundamental physics are correct**: Strong FD correlation (ρ=0.88) validates core Q-ρ relationships
2. **Model architecture is sound**: Two-class LWR framework captures essential dynamics
3. **Statistical significance**: Clear differentiation between vehicle classes (p<0.001)

**Challenges Identified** ❌:
1. **Speed differential over-predicted**: 10.0 km/h predicted vs 1.8 km/h observed (82% error)
2. **Throughput ratio inverted**: Predicted Q_m > Q_c, observed Q_c > Q_m (56% error)
3. **Infiltration under-observed**: 50-80% expected vs 29% observed

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:

The validation suggests **parametric calibration issues** rather than fundamental model flaws:
- ✅ Core physics (Q-ρ) validated → architecture correct
- ❌ Behavioral parameters (Δv, infiltration) fail → need recalibration

**Plausible Explanations**:
1. **Context Mismatch**: ARZ calibrated for hypothetical West African urban traffic; Lagos reality differs
2. **Infrastructure Impact**: Physical constraints (barriers, lane design) not captured in model
3. **Behavioral Factors**: Driver/rider behavior more conservative than theoretical expectations
4. **Data Limitations**: Segment-level aggregates may not capture instantaneous phenomena

### Implications for Thesis

**Revendication R2 Status**: ❌ **NOT VALIDATED** (1/4 tests passed)

However, this is **NOT** a complete failure of the ARZ model. Instead:

1. **Partial Validation**: Fundamental diagram correlation strongly validated
2. **Calibration Need**: Speed and infiltration parameters require adjustment
3. **Data Quality Caveat**: Validation limited by segment-level data (not trajectories)
4. **Research Direction**: Results suggest profitable path for model refinement

**Recommended Thesis Framing**:

Instead of claiming **"ARZ matches West African traffic"**, frame as:

> **"ARZ captures fundamental two-class traffic flow physics (validated by strong Q-ρ correlation, ρ=0.88), but requires context-specific calibration of behavioral parameters (speed differential, infiltration) for Lagos conditions. Validation with real Lagos TomTom data reveals parametric discrepancies (82% error in Δv, 56% error in Q_m/Q_c) while confirming structural soundness of the two-class LWR framework."**

This framing:
- ✅ Acknowledges strong FD validation (your main contribution)
- ✅ Honestly reports parametric failures (scientific integrity)
- ✅ Identifies clear next steps (calibration, better data)
- ✅ Positions ARZ as sound but needing refinement (realistic)
