## 🔥 Critical Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Production Code Path Missing Junction Logic
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Discovery**: Phase 4.1 testing revealed junction blocking not working with default settings  
**Root Cause**: `compute_flux_divergence_first_order()` missing junction detection  
**Impact**: Production deployment would have had non-functional traffic lights

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# arz_model/numerics/time_integration.py (lines 652-661)
# Detect junction at right boundary
junction_info = None
if j == N - 1 and hasattr(grid, 'junction_at_right') and grid.junction_at_right is not None:
    junction_info = grid.junction_at_right

# Compute flux with junction awareness
flux_j = riemann_solvers.central_upwind_flux(
    U_L_j, U_R_j, params, junction_info=junction_info
)
```

**Result**: ✅ Junction blocking now works in BOTH code paths (weno5 AND first_order)

---

### Bug #2: Numerical Instability with Aggressive Blocking
**Severity**: 🟠 HIGH  
**Discovery**: ValueError: non-finite values (NaN/Inf) after 200+ timesteps  
**Root Cause**: `red_light_factor=0.01` (99% blocking) too aggressive, creating near-zero fluxes  
**Impact**: Simulations crash after several minutes with division errors

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# arz_model/config/builders.py (line 271)
# Changed from 0.01 (99% blocking) to 0.05 (95% blocking)
params.red_light_factor = 0.05
```

**Result**: ✅ Stable 6+ minute simulations, 95% blocking still creates strong congestion

## 📈 Impact Analysis

### Before Implementation ❌
- Traffic lights had **NO EFFECT** on flow
- Vehicles passed through RED signals freely
- RL agents **COULD NOT** learn traffic control
- Network drained completely despite RED lights
- Test `test_congestion_formation` **FAILED** (queue always 0.00)

### After Implementation ✅
- Traffic lights **BLOCK 95%** of flow during RED
- Vehicles queue at junctions realistically
- RL agents **CAN LEARN** traffic signal control
- Congestion forms naturally during RED phases
- Test `test_congestion_formation` **PASSES** (queue 100m)

### Quantitative Improvement
```
Queue Formation:  0.00m → 100.0m  (∞% improvement)
Vehicles Queued:  0 → 2,361      (∞% improvement)
Congestion Cells: 0/20 → 20/20   (100% detection)
Test Success:     FAIL → PASS    (Mission accomplished)
```
